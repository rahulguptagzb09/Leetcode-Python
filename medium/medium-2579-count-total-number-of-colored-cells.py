2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells
There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer n, indicating that you must do the following routine for n minutes:
At the first minute, color any arbitrary unit cell blue.
Every minute thereafter, color blue every uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.
Below is a pictorial representation of the state of the grid after minutes 1, 2, and 3.
Return the number of colored cells at the end of n minutes.
Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.
Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5. 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
Hint 1
Derive a mathematical relation between total number of colored cells and the time elapsed in minutes.

# Time - O(n or 1)
# Space - O(1)

class Solution:
    def coloredCells(self, n: int) -> int:
        # res = 1
        # for i in range(n):
        #     res += (4 * i)
        # return res

        return 1 + 4 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)

sol = Solution()
print(sol.coloredCells(n = 1))
print(sol.coloredCells(n = 2))
