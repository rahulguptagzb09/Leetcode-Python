1288. Remove Covered Intervals
Given an array intervals where intervals[i] = [li, ri] represent the interval [li, ri), remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.
The interval [a, b) is covered by the interval [c, d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.
Return the number of remaining intervals.
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Constraints:
1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= li < ri <= 105
All the given intervals are unique.
Hint 1
How to check if an interval is covered by another?
Hint 2
Compare each interval to all others and check if it is covered by any interval.
