1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters
Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.
Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
Constraints:
3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
s only consists of a, b or c characters.
Hint 1
For each position we simply need to find the first occurrence of a/b/c on or after this position.
Hint 2
So we can pre-compute three link-list of indices of each a, b, and c.
