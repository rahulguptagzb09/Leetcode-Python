1897. Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal
You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).
In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].
Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Move the first 'a' in words[1] to the front of words[2],
to make words[1] = "abc" and words[2] = "abc".
All the strings are now equal to "abc", so return true.
Example 2:
Input: words = ["ab","a"]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make all the strings equal using the operation.
Constraints:
1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 100
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
