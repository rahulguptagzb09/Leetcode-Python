1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5
Easy
You are given a binary array nums (0-indexed).
We define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).
For example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5.
Return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false]
Explanation: The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.
Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: [false,false,false]
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
Hint 1
If X is the first i digits of the array as a binary number, then 2X + A[i] is the first i+1 digits.
